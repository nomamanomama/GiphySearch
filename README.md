# GiphySearch
This page has category tabs and topic search buttons that perform a giphy search to display a list of the top ten giphy from giphy.com for that category and topic.

## Example
Three categories exist for flowers, cars and animals. Within each category tab, 10 topic search buttons are shown at the top. The user can enter a new topic on the right to create a new search button. The user can also create new categories by clicking on the tab labeled "+". Once a topic search button is clicked, the top 10 giphys for that category and topic are displayed. Click on the "Star" icon to save a giphy to the "Favorites" tab. Click the download icon to initiate a 1-click download of the giphy. Users category tabs, selected tab and favorites are stored and will persist when the page is closed and reloaded. 


## Motivation
The initial category created was flowers. Since the functionality was modular, it made sense to create additional categories and display them in tabs. The giphy items are brightly colored so the b&w background themes are meant to pertain to the topic without detracting from the search results.


## Installation or Getting Started

This giphy search is accessed by the web. To get started click any topic button.
